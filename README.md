# Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This repository aims to implement a general purpose ANN in Python. Heavily inspired by machine learning/Neural Network tools such as Tensorflow and SciKit. 

Projects uses "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/satishgunjal/datasets/master/admission_basedon_exam_scores.csv" dataset which includes 100 records with 3 features to predict admission chances based on exam scores in 2 subjects.
Model uses 20% data for validation and accuracy in current state is 50-60%.
